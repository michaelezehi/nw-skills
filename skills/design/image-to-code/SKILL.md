## Unlazy gate (runs before this skill's own steps)

Before any of the work below, write `GATES.md` in the working directory: one
`- [ ]` box per outcome this run has to deliver, each with a `CHECK:` shell
command, an `EXPECT:` match string, and `EVIDENCE: pending`. Full format in
`~/.claude/skills/unlazy/SKILL.md` and its `references/gates.md`.

- Flip boxes with `node ~/.claude/skills/unlazy/scripts/gate-check.mjs GATES.md`.
  A box is only checked when the command output matches EXPECT.
- A checked box whose `EVIDENCE:` still reads `pending` is unmet, not done.
- Every number that will appear in the final report gets its own gate that
  measures it. No counts, percentages, or file totals stated from memory.
- CHECK commands stay cheap and non-interactive: typecheck, tests, lint, grep,
  `wc -l`, file counts. Never a dev server, a browser, or a deploy.
- If a gate turns out to be impossible, add `ABANDON: G<n> <reason>` to the file
  and name it in the report. Never drop a gate silently.
- No report until the ledger is full. Paste it, N of N checked.
- If `GATES.md` already exists for the task this run belongs to (a skill that
  invoked this one, or an auto-review after it), append gates and continue the
  ids. Never overwrite a ledger with unmet boxes.

Five to twelve gates is the useful range for one run. Skip the gate file only
for a genuinely trivial invocation (a one-line fix, a single lookup).

## Owned files only (every agent, every review)

Other agents share this branch. Your task owns the paths you were given
plus the paths you create; `git status --porcelain` at the start lists
what is already claimed by someone else. Full rule:
`~/.claude/skills/unlazy/references/ownership.md`.

- Edit only your paths. Never revert, restore, reformat, tidy or delete a
  file you do not own, even if it looks broken; report the path instead.
- In a shared file, change only your hunks and leave the other agent's
  hunks exactly as found.
- A sub-agent owns exactly the paths in its brief. Needs another path: stop
  and report, never take it.
- Every review or supervisor pass covers only this task's paths and
  commits, never "the branch" or "the diff since main". Other agents'
  files get reviewed when their task finishes.
- Finished with a file or a set of files: check it in and commit it right
  then, with a message that says what changed and why it was wrong
  before. Never carry finished work uncommitted into the next file, and
  never save it all for one commit at the end.
- Commit by path: `git commit -m "..." -- <your paths>`. Never `git add -A`,
  `git add .`, `git add -u`, `git commit -a`, stash, restore, checkout or
  reset.


Read and follow ~/.claude/skills/imagegen-frontend-web/SKILL.md.

That skill owns the whole image-first web flow: one horizontal image per section, deep image analysis, then faithful design-to-code implementation (`~/.claude/skills/imagegen-frontend-web/reference/image-analysis.md`, `~/.claude/skills/imagegen-frontend-web/reference/implementation.md`).
