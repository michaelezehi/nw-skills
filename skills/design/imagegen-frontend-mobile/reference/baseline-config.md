Instruction:
Use these as defaults unless the user clearly wants something else.
Adapt them to the app category.

Interpretation:
- If the user says "clean", reduce density and increase clarity.
- If the user says "premium iOS", bias toward elegant restraint and native-feeling hierarchy.
- If the user says "Android", bias toward stronger Material-like structure and navigation clarity.
- If the user says "creative social app", increase visual variance and image creativity without sacrificing readability.
- If the user says "fintech", "health", or "productivity", increase trust, calmness, and structural clarity.
- Do not be lazy with screen count.
- If more screens would make the flow better, generate more screens.
- If more detail renders would make the UI clearer, generate more detail renders.
- Default toward richer art direction than standard AI mobile output.
- Use creative assets, texture, and imagery deliberately, not randomly.
- Always keep the color palette clean, controlled, and intentional.
- Avoid generic color choices.
- Do not force every app into ultra-simple minimalism.
- Keep text comfortably readable at normal viewing size.
- Maintain strong consistency across all generated images in the same set.
- Keep device framing neat, even, and professional.
- Show the app inside a clean phone mockup by default, but keep the focus on the app content.
